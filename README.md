# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project


This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Course Project of "Getting and Cleaning data", from the Data Science's track course available in coursera.


The dataset being used is https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 


## Files

- ```CodeBook.md```: Contains the description of the assignment, information on the raw data and all the variables, data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

- ```run_analysis.R```: R script that reproduces all the steps necessary to complete the assignment. It can be run in R directly without having the data downloaded (it will skip the download if the data is already in the working directory).

- ```tidy_data.txt```: Output file when running the script, containing the clean data set asked in the assignment.
